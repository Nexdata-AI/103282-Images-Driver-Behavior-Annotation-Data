# 103282-Images-Driver-Behavior-Annotation-Data


## Description
103,282-Images Driver Behavior Annotation Data. The data includes multiple ages, multiple time periods and behaviors (Dangerous behaviors, Fatigue behaviors, Visual movement behaviors). In terms of annotation, 72 facial landmarks (including pupils), face attributes, gesture bounding boxes, seatbelt bounding boxes, pupil landmarks and behavior categories were annotated in the data. This data can be used for tasks such as driver behavior analysis.
